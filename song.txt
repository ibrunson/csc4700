As you go through life you'll see there is so much that we don't understand.
And the only thing we know, is things don't always go they way we've planned.
But you'll see everyday that we'll never turn away, when it seems all your dreams come undone.
we will stand by your side filled with hope and filled with pride
we are more than we are, we are one.
Family, family, we are one.
Family, family, we are one.
If there's so much I must be can I still just be me, the way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart, or am I just one part of some big plan?
Even those who are gone are with us as we go on.
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy one thing nothing can destroy:
is our pride deep inside we are one.
Family, family we are one.
Family, Family we are one.
We are one, you and I, we are like the earh and sky: 
one family under the sun. 
All the wisdom to lead, all the courage that you need, 
you will find when we see we are one.
